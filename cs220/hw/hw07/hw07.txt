1. Given the following code:
	int x = -5;
	int y = x/2;
	int z = x>>1;
	
   a. Will "y" and "z" have the same value?  If so, why? If not, why not? No, they will have different values because their respective operations handle remainders differently.
   
   b. Is the statement "shifting to the right is the same as dividing by two" correct? Only when working with unsigned values.
   
2. Given the following C code (where %p in printf means print the hexadecimal value of a pointer):

	int vec[4]={6,7,8,9};
	int * vecptr=vec;
	printf("Vector is at %p\n",vecptr);
	printf("vec[2] is at %p\n",vecptr+2);
	printf("vec[2] is not at %p\n", (char *)vecptr+2);
	
   If the first printf statement results in "Vector is at 0x5fcb00", 
   
   	a) What will the second printf statement print? 0x5fcb08
   	
   	b) What will the third printf statement print? 0x5fcb02
   	
3. What are the three ways we have discussed in class to determine the x86 assembler instructions generated by
   compiling a C program? GDB, -S, objdump 

   
4. If you are on a little-endian machine that uses 32 bit integers, define a "palindromic" number as a number
   for which x==htonl(x). Is 16,843,009 a "palindromic" number?  Why or why not? Yes, because the little-endian representation rearranges the bytes, not the bits so the order of bits is palindromic. The value 0x1010101 is the palindromic hex representation of 16843009.
   
5. The standard library function "float powf(float a,float b)" returns the value of "a" to the power of "b".  
   For instance, powf(2.0,3.0) return 2.0 x 2.0 x 2.0 = 8.0.  Find an integer value for "exp" for which the 
   FRAC bits of the expression "powf(2.0,exp)" is non-zero. (Warning: the representation of INFINITY in floating
   point has zero FRAC bits.) There would be non--zero FRAC bits for any value of "exp" between -127 and -149 (denormal).
